Please use this link to download the code. Once the download is complete open the file by using Xcode on a mac device. I have implemented a view on the code so make sure that your run the app on a ios device or an Xcode simulator to start using and testing the app. The language that I have used is Swift and I have commented most codes that might be challenging for the developers to read.
